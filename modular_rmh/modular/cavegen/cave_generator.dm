//RMH EDITED START - zone cave generation
/**
 * Hybrid cave generator.
 *
 * Pure cellular automata produces blobs, not tunnels.
 * This one builds the skeleton explicitly and only uses CA to roughen it up:
 *
 *   1. split the painted area into contiguous regions (one painted blob = one cave system)
 *   2. erode a solid rim so the zone border never opens into neighbouring rooms
 *   3. Poisson-disk seed chamber centres, carve noise-warped blobs around them
 *   4. connect the chambers with a minimum spanning tree, each edge walked by a
 *      goal-biased drunkard walk with a variable brush -> winding tunnels
 *   5. a couple of CA passes to make the walls organic (tunnel spines are protected)
 *   6. drop disconnected pockets left over by the CA
 *   7. paint turfs, then seed ore veins into rock that actually touches a cave
