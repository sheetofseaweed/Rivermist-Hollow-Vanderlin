// Hunting & Tracking pack - footprints left by people.
//
// Built on the core /obj/effect/skill_tracker + SStrackables framework, whose base class already
// carries the track fields (track_type, facing, depth, overwrites and friends).
//
// The movement hook hangs off /mob/living/carbon/human/Moved(), NOT /mob/living/Moved(). Core
// already defines the latter (code/modules/mob/living/living_movement.dm), and a second definition
// of the same proc on the same type from this layer would silently win over it - see
// ai_navigation/modular_guide.md - dropping stop_looking(), update_turf_movespeed() and
// consider_ambush(). Subtyping one level down is ordinary DM inheritance and chains through ..().
//
// Visibility model: the object itself is invisible to everyone. A mob that
// finds a track gets their own /image of it, so two people standing on the same tile can disagree
// about whether there is anything there. Examining goes through the turf (see /turf/open/examine
// below), the same way core routes thieves' cant examines through /turf/closed.
