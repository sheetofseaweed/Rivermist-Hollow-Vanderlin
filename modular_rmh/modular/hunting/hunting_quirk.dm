// Hunting & Tracking pack - the character-creation entry for TRAIT_PERFECT_TRACKER.
//
// Traits themselves are not picked at chargen in this codebase; quirks are, and quirks grant
// traits. init_quirk_registry() builds the picker from subtypesof(/datum/quirk), so declaring the
// boon here is enough - no core traits list needs editing.
//
// Pattern copied from /datum/quirk/boon/light_footed in code/datums/quirks/boon/_boon.dm.
