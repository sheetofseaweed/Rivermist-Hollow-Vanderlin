/**
 * Build mode undo: the last BM_UNDO_STEPS placements, paints, erases and deletions can be undone
 * (Ctrl + Z, or the Undo button in the catalogue).
 *
 * Placed objects are deleted on undo; changed turfs get their previous type back. Deleted objects
 * are not destroyed at once: they wait in nullspace while their step can still be undone, and are
 * destroyed for good when the step falls off the stack or the admin leaves build mode.
 * Mobs removed by an area erase cannot be brought back.
 *
 * Each action records into its own step, handed from begin_undo() to end_undo(), so an action that
 * sleeps (a constructor, a long paint spread over ticks) never mixes with the next one.
 *
 * Tracked objects are watched with COMSIG_PARENT_QDELETING. A plain reference would turn every
 * object deleted by something else while its step waits (food eaten, a torch burning out in
 * nullspace) into a hard delete, and a weakref mints a REF() text per object: a big paint mints
 * thousands of them in creation order, which makes BYOND stop and re-sort its whole string table.
